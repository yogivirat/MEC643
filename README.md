# Solar-Driven Water Solutions: Addressing Global Warming, Water Scarcity, and Energy Needs.

## Introduction

Water scarcity and energy sustainability are critical global challenges, particularly as climate change exacerbates resource availability and demand. In Canada, Southern Alberta and British Columbia face unique but significant water management issues. Southern Alberta contends with severe agricultural water stress driven by semi-arid conditions and over-reliance on fossil-fuel-based energy
Conversely, British Columbia experiences seasonal water shortages, compounded by industrial and forestry demands, despite its abundant hydroelectric resources. Both regions require innovative, sustainable solutions to meet their water and energy needs.

Solar desalination offers a transformative approach to address these challenges by leveraging renewable solar energy for water purification and desalination. This technology aligns with regional sustainability goals, providing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional water supply method. By integrating economic, environmental, and sensitivity analyses, this project explores the feasibility and impact of solar desalination systems tailored to the distinct conditions of Southern Alberta and British Columbia. Through region-specific frameworks, this study contributes actionable insights for advancing renewable water management technologies in Canada.

## Project Objective

1.	To analyze the economic feasibility of solar desalination systems in Southern Alberta and British Columbia through cost comparisons with traditional water supply methods [6].
2.	To assess the environmental impact, specifically COâ‚‚ emissions, of solar desalination systems in both regions.
3.	To conduct sensitivity analyses to identify critical parameters influencing the Levelized Cost of Water (LCOW) for each region.
4.	To provide region-specific recommendations for adopting solar desalination systems, aligning with local energy profiles, water demands, and sustainability goals.
5.	To contribute actionable insights into the broader adoption of renewable water management technologies in Canada.
